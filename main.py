############### Blackjack Project 

#TODO:1. Create a deal_card() function that uses the List below to *return* a random card.
#11 is the Ace.
#cards = [11, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10, 10, 10]
import random
from replit import clear 
from art import logo
"""returns a random cards from the deck"""
def deal_card():
  cards=[11,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,10,10]
  card = random.choice(cards)
  return card

#TODO:3. Create a function called calculate_score() that takes a List of cards as input 
#and returns the score. 
#Look up the sum() function to help you do this.

def calculate_score(cards):
  """take a list of card and return the score calculated from the cards"""

#TODO:4. Inside calculate_score() check for a blackjack (a hand with only 2 cards: ace + 10) and return 0 instead of the actual score. 0 will represent a blackjack in our game.
  if sum(cards)==21 and len(cards)==2 :
    return 0
  
#TODO:5. Inside calculate_score() check for an 11 (ace). If the score is already over 21, remove the 11 and replace it with a 1. You might need to look up append() and remove().
  if 11 in cards and sum(cards)>21:
    cards.remove(11)
    cards.append(1)

  return sum(cards)

#TODO:10. Create a function called compare() and pass in the user_score and computer_score. If the computer and user both have the same score, then it's a draw. If the computer has a blackjack (0), then the user loses. If the user has a blackjack (0), then the user wins. If the user_score is over 21, then the user loses. If the computer_score is over 21, then the computer loses. If none of the above, then the player with the highest score wins.

  if computer_score == user_score:
    return "Draw"
